The aim of this guide is
- to document basic steps for myself as a reference book.
- for others to provide an understanding of my structure if they want to use and understand my code.

The tools and language I address are
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- Python
- git and github
- pdoc (to gernerate html documentation)


My current contents are
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](./MyDevGuide/Visual Studio Code (VSCode).html)
  <br> How I setup and use VSCode.

- [Development Process](./MyDevGuide/Development Process.html)
<br> The file and folder structure of my projects and how it is used with git.

- [my pdoc cheat sheet](./MyDevGuide/my pdoc cheat sheet.html)
<br> The elements I use frequently to generate HTML documentation with pdoc.
